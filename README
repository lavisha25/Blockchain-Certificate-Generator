🏆 Blockchain Certificate Generator
The Blockchain Certificate Generator is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows authorized issuers to create and verify certificates using blockchain technology. It ensures security, transparency, and tamper-proof storage of digital credentials, eliminating the risk of forgery and providing permanent verification.

📜 Features
🔒 Immutable Certificates – Once issued, certificates cannot be changed or deleted.

🌐 Decentralized Verification – Anyone can verify a certificate using its unique ID.

💡 User-Friendly Interface – Simple web UI for issuing and verifying certificates.

🔗 Blockchain-Powered – All data is stored on the Ethereum blockchain.

💳 MetaMask Integration – Secure wallet connection for transaction signing.
